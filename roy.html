<div class="heu">This days, I'm playing game "League Of Legends" from Riot Games with my friends, It is pretty good game to enjoy with my friends. One point of this game is that they always faulting people and start to fight in online. Thats kind of funny when I look them fighting each other while gaming.</div>
<h6>Games. Everybody likes it. Games give us uncompareable joyfulness when I won a game with friends.<br>
I play game usually in weekends, or anyday I have plenty of free time. Sometime we could lose, but we thought we were just unlucky match. We don't need to be stress ful while gaming, we could concentrate on games without thinking about works todo. <br> &ltCaution!&gt Better play after finishing the works. While we play game, the time will flow faster than you thought.<br>I prefer to play various games than mastering a game. I enjoy to play a game with my friends, playing game with friend will make you to en joy the game in 200%.  </h6></div>
